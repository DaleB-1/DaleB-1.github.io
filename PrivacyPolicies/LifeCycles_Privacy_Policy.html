      <h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Summary</h1>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;">You will be required to enter your name and date of birth but this data is stored on your device only and is deleted if you remove the app. The app also saves files to your photo gallery but only if you give it permission and actually use the camera feature. You can delete these files any time you want to, just like you can with any other photos you take. Absolutely NONE of your data, personal or otherwise, is collected or stored. What more can I say?</p>
