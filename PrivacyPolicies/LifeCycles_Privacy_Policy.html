      <h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Summary</h1>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;">1) You will be required to enter your name and date of birth but this data is stored on your device only and is deleted if you remove the app.</p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;">2) The app saves files to your photo gallery but only if you give it permission and actually use the camera feature. You can delete these files any time you want to, just like you can with any other photos you take.</p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;">3) The app keeps track of how many times you use it and prompts you to rate the app in the Google Play Store after every 100 uses. You can decline to rate it but I'd be very grateful if you tell me what you think about the app. </p>
