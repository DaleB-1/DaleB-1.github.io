      <p style="font-family:verdana;">This privacy policy applies to the Cribbage 2020 app available in the Google Play Store.</p>

      <h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Summary</h1>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;">This is not a gambling app. It is based on the centuries old card game of Cribbage. You play against your electronic device for the fun of it. That's all!</p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;">It will store the results of your matches on your device but only if you give it permission to do so and you can delete the stored results at any time.</p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;">The app keeps track of how many times you use it and prompts you to rate the app in the Google Play Store after every 100 uses. You can decline to rate it but I'd be very grateful if you tell me what you think about the app. </p>
      <p style="font-family:verdana;">Absolutely NONE of your personal data is collected or stored. What more can I say?</p>
